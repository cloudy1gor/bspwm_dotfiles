IMPORTANT

Do NOT edit the default SublimeCodeIntel settings. Your changes will be lost
when SublimeCodeIntel is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeCodeIntel settings
by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeCodeIntel->Settings - User".
Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely**
replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.
