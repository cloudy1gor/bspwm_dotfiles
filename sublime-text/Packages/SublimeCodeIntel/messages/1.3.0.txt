Please restart Sublime Text 2 after reading this.

CHANGES/FIXES

+ This build should fix many of the problems seen in Linux systems.

- Libraries for Linux rebuilt with libpcre statically (libpcre bundled for Linux builds).

- ``calltip()`` is now thread safe (which caused some strange behavior in Linux
  where Sublime Text 2 ended up being unresponsive).
